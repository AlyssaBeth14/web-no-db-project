# Book Tracker

Book Tracker is an app that keeps track of books you've read. The tracker allows you to display the cover, author, title, genre, and your own personal rating of any books you want to add to your list. Don't want a book on your list anymore? Delete it. Accidentally misspell the author's name? Edit the book at your leisure.
